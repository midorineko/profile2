<div id="mybio">I adopted the difficult role of pursuing a career as a technical biologist. My passions include computer technology and human genetics. I plan on combining my two loves by helping build the largest human genome database. I attended UC Berkeley to obtain a degree in Evolutionary Medicine then went to Dev Bootcamp to build a strong computer programming foundation. I enjoy working within a team to achieve maximum efficiency and quality. I am willing to fulfill a variety of roles in order to produce successful results. Feel free to leave your email, company, and open positions above. It allows me to contact you.</div>
